# Marketing Attribution Analysis

This project analyses multi-channel marketing interaction data to understand how different platforms contribute to user acquisition and conversions.  

## Key Features
- **Data Preparation & Feature Engineering**: Constructed user journeys from raw interaction logs with path ordering, time differences, and journey length metrics.  
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Funnel visualisation, conversion rates by channel, and customer journey length distribution.  
- **Attribution Modelling**: Implemented multiple attribution models:
  - First-Touch  
  - Last-Touch  
  - Linear  
  - Position-Based (40-20-40)  
- **Channel Role Identification**: Classified channels as **introducers**, **closers**, or **supporting** players.  
- **Insights & Recommendations**: Strategic guidance for budget allocation across Facebook, Paid Search, Online Video, Instagram, and Display.  

## Outcomes
- Facebook and Paid Search consistently emerge as the strongest revenue drivers.  
- Online Video plays a dual role (awareness + closing).  
- Instagram and Display are supportive, best for nurturing and retargeting.  
- Results highlight the importance of adopting **hybrid or data-driven attribution** over single-touch models.  

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Data visualisation for attribution insights  

**Use Case**: Marketers and analysts can apply this framework to evaluate channel effectiveness, optimise budget allocation, and strengthen digital campaign strategies.
